            <p>Why Slow Steiner?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are four affordable senior housing buildings within two blocks of Duboce Park. Many residents have expressed fear over fast-moving cars and unsafe street crossings. Our neighbor Michael was recently hit in his wheelchair by a car speeding down Steiner and turning up Duboce Ave. A safer and slower Steiner would provide residents of all ages and abilites a safer connection to the park.</li>
                <li>Slow Steiner is a pedestrian and bike artery across the city. A Slow Steiner would better support these already common uses of this stretch of Steiner, reducing conflcits between cars, bikes, and pedestrians.</li>
            </ul>
