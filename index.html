        <ul>
          <li>
            There are four affordable housing buildings with hundreds of eldery
            and disabled residents within two blocks of Duboce Park. Many have
            expressed fear over fast-moving cars and unsafe street crossings.
            Our neighbor Michael was recently hit in his wheelchair by a car
            speeding down Steiner and turning up Duboce Ave. A safer and slower
            Steiner would provide neighbors of all ages and abilites a safer
            connection to the park.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a part of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle">The Wiggle</a>,
            Steiner between Duboce and Waller is a pedestrian and bike artery
            across the city. A Slow Steiner would better support these already
            common uses of Steiner by reducing motor vehicle traffic and speed,
            providing a safer corridor for pedestrians and bicylists.

          What is the background and context behind Slow Steiner?

          Slow Steiner has grown out of

            >DTNA's Vision 2030 initiative</a

          (née Slow Triangle). Grounded in the results of a series of community
          workshops and surveys starting in 2022 (<a

          traffic calming throughout Duboce Triangle. Over the past year, based
          on community input, particular attention has been given to Sanchez and
          Steiner, and in particular the intersection at Duboce/Sanchez/Steiner. We think that a Slow Steiner will help make the Duboce/Sanchez/Steiner intersection safer, while also

        <p class="title">Wiggle Fest</p>
          <p>
            In October 2023, we hosted our first Wiggle Fest, closing Steiner to
            cars between Duboce and Hermann. In addition to bringing together
            neighbors and building community, it was an opportunity to reflect
            and reimagine how Steiner could best serve the neighborhood.

            “I am 100% pro Slow Steiner. My mother is a resident of Bridge
            Housing. She and her many friends and their families would love safe
            access to the park and cafés like everyone else. They should be
            afforded the same type of recreation the existing Slow Streets offer
            younger and non-disabled people.” <div class="quote-author">Whaticia Patterson</div>

            hundreds of elderly and disabled residents of Bridge Housing. I
            support a Slow Steiner 100%. This would provide safer access to the
