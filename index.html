        <p class="title">Why Slow Steiner?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are four affordable housing buildings with hundreds of eldery
            and disabled residents within two blocks of Duboce Park. Many have
            expressed fear over fast-moving cars and unsafe street crossings.
            Our neighbor Michael was recently hit in his wheelchair by a car
            speeding down Steiner and turning up Duboce Ave. A safer and slower
            Steiner would provide neighbors of all ages and abilites a safer
            connection to the park.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a part of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle">The Wiggle</a>,
            Steiner between Duboce and Waller is a pedestrian and bike artery
            across the city. A Slow Steiner would better support these already
            common uses of Steiner by reducing motor vehicle traffic and speed,
            providing a safer corridor for pedestrians and bicylists.

          What is the background and context behind Slow Steiner?

          Slow Steiner has grown out of

            >DTNA's Vision 2030 initiative</a
          >
          (formerly “Slow Triangle”). Grounded in the results of a series of
          community workshops and surveys starting in 2022 (<a

            >2</a
          >), efforts have been focused on improving pedestrian safety and
          traffic calming throughout Duboce Triangle. Over the past year, based
          on community input, particular attention has been given to Sanchez and
          Steiner, and in particular, the intersection at
          Duboce/Sanchez/Steiner.

        <p>
          Every six months, we host Wiggle Fest, closing Steiner to cars between
          Duboce and Hermann. In addition to bringing neighbors together and
          building community, Wiggle Fest is an opportunity to reflect and
          reimagine how Steiner could best serve the neighborhood.

        <p>Stay tuned for our fifth Wiggle Fest in fall 2025!</p>

            “For the past three years, I have guided walks around Duboce Park
            and the surrounding neighborhood for senior citizens. One recurring
            challenge that has caught my attention is the confusing nature of
            the intersection at Duboce, Steiner, and Sanchez as well as Steiner
            and Hermann. These intersections tend to cause confusion and
            hesitation among pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, leading to a
            serious safety hazard for all. The complexity of these intersections
            often leave individuals uncertain about the right of way, posing a
            risk to everyone, including drivers. The peculiar layout of the
            intersection makes it particularly dangerous, with cars frequently
            speeding through, causing distress among the senior citizens I
            accompany during our walks. In light of these concerns, our weekly
            walking group earnestly advocates for the implementation of a Slow
            Steiner Street to enhance the safety of our community. Your support
            for this initiative would undoubtedly contribute to creating a more
            secure environment for our neighborhood.”
